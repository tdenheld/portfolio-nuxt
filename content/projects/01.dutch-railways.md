      ## Adoption

      A design system only succeeds when it's actually used. To ensure adoption, we established a dedicated system team and made it mandatory for new features to use our components. Our biggest breakthrough came when we helped rebuild the outdated online ticket sales application from scratch.

      I worked closely with UX designers to refine their layouts using our components and built a polished front-end prototype in Angular. This became a benchmark for the development team and helped set the tone for future projects, enabling more teams to adopt the new design system with confidence and consistency.
