      ## Scaling Design
      I focus on design strategy, brand consistency and front-end architecture. I translate design decisions into system patterns and provide direction and mentorship to designers and developers, aligning teams around a shared vision.

      ## Building the System
      I craft scalable UI components using Tokens, Astro and StencilJS, documented and validated in Storybook, with a strong focus on accessibility and maintainability. I actively explore emerging CSS specifications and modern tooling, including AI-assisted workflows. This supports automation, documentation and workflows, enhancing both developer experience and system adoption.

      ## Adoption

      A design system succeeds when it's actually used. To ensure adoption, NS established a dedicated team and made it mandatory for new features to use the system. Our biggest breakthrough came when I helped rebuilding the ticket and subscription applications.

      I worked closely with feature teams to refine their UI and front-end architecture. I built a polished [prototype](https://nessie.netlify.app) in Angular which became a benchmark and set the tone for future projects, helping more teams adopt the new design system with confidence and consistency. The improved implementation also led to a 15% increase in customers completing their subscription purchases.
